Delimiter program features:

- The (Clipboard Preview) listbox is not useful to select, just to preview that the import split the list correctly into a list for preview

- by default when (Other Input Delimit) is not populated, the import will split the clipboard by either <tab> or <carriage return>, ELSE if populated, it will split the import by this Other Input Delimit.

- (Other Output Delimit) allows one to export the list utilizing that delimiter.

NOTE.. even copying and pasting an Invisible (tab) or (carriage return) character into the (Other Output Delimit) field will allow you do delimit by tabs or carriage return

- (Prefix) if populated will infuse the prefix to each list element as it's delimiting

- checkbox options will allow one to also surround the list items by brackets and/or single OR double quotes

- Buttons are to import what you have copied into your clipboard and export what is listed in the Clipboard preview. 

NOTE.. export can be done as many times as one wishes on the list that is already imported.. Even if one wishes to toggle any of the selectables, the Export button will dynamically formulate an output based on the latest selections.
